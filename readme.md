## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to get LabCohort up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v14 or higher recommended)
* Git

### 1. Clone the Repository

```
$ git clone https://github.com/narayandabu/Rchef.git
```
```cd Rchef```

### 2. Backend Setup
Navigate to the server directory, install dependencies, and create your environment file.
Then :

```cd .Bbackend```

```npm install```

 Then to start the Backend Server use:
```npm run dev```
or ```npm start```

- The backend server will run on http://localhost:5000 (or your specified PORT).

### 3. Frontend Setup
Open a new terminal, navigate to the client directory, and install dependencies.

``` cd ./Frontend```

```npm install ```

- The frontend application automatically looks for the backend at http://localhost:5000 (as configured in pckage.jsson as  "proxy": "http://localhost:5000"). If you changed the backend port, you might need to update axiosInstance.js accordingly.

Now, start the frontend development server:

```npm start``` or use

```npm run dev```

The frontend application will open in your browser at http://localhost:5173 as I have configured it to do so you can change it in my npm setup.
